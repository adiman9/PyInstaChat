# PyInstaChat

While at University I studied Computer Networks. During this module we were given the task of creating an instant chatting client using Python. At this point in time I had a basic understanding of Python, but nothing major. 

The result of this work is the code in this repo. The code for both the client side and the server side was written as part of this project in an attempt to understand a bit more about both TCP and UDP communications on networks.

The client itself is very primative but does allow all connected clients to view all other clients on the network at the current time, although no formal friends system is implemented. All users can then send messages to one or more of the other online users. This demonstrates one to one communications as well as one to many communications.
